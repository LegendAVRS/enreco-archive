                Just like the Scarlet Wand, the Cerulean Cup launched their own
                minigame on Day 7. As representatives of empathy, they designed
                a game that would help spread that very value: Catching
                Chickens.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the name suggests, the goal is simple—catch chickens… but
                empathetically. Players are presented with a board where
                chickens continuously spawn from the top and slowly fall
                downward. The objective? Move your basket horizontally along the
                bottom and catch as many falling chickens as possible within the
                time limit.
            </p>
            <p> That's it. Simple and fun.</p>
