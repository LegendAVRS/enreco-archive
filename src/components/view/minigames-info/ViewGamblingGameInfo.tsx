                The most frequently visited minigame—or rather, venue—of Chapter
                One was undoubtedly the Amber Coin Casino, where everyone could
                indulge in their favorite pastime: gambling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The casino's signature minigame functions like a roulette of
                sorts. A board displays four different colors, each occupying a
                set number of squares with a corresponding multiplier:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span className="text-blue-600">Blue:</span> 12 squares, 2x
                    multiplier
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span className="text-green-600">Green:</span> 8 squares, 3x
                    multiplier
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span className="text-yellow-600">Yellow:</span> 4 squares,
                    5x multiplier
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span className="text-red-600">Red:</span> 1 square, 10x
                    multiplier
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Players can choose how much to bet on each color. Once the game
                begins, colors are eliminated one by one, slowly whittling down
                the board—until only one remained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whoever bets on the final color would receive their wager
                multiplied accordingly.
