                The Scarlet Wand's Memory Game was introduced on Day 7 of the
                journey. As its name suggests, its main purpose is to test the
                memory of our heroes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon starting the game, each round presents a white board where
                a number of squares light up in one of four colors—red, green,
                blue, or yellow. After about two seconds, the colors vanish, and
                the player must recreate the original pattern.
            </p>

            <p>
                If they get it right, their score increases, and the difficulty
                ramps up, presenting a more complex pattern. If they get it
                wrong, they lose points, and the difficulty decreases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game continues until the 60-second timer runs out. Up to
                four players can compete at the same time, and whoever has the
                highest score at the end earns bragging rights.
